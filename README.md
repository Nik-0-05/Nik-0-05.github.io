# My Personal Website
This website showcases my professional profile and portfolio. It is created using a template from [HTML5 UP](https://html5up.net/). I customized the template to match my personal style and needs, including adding new icons, modifying the layout, and tweaking the overall design.

## Customizations
I modified the template's HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to tailor the design and functionality to my specific needs. Key modifications included:
- **Personalizing content:** Added my personal information, projects, and skills.
- **Linking projects:** Each project is linked with a short description and a thumbnail representing the analysis or work involved.
- **Highlighting trading experience:** Added a section that highlights my previous work as an independent derivatives trader.
- **Integrating professional platforms:** Linked to my GitHub, Kaggle, Tableau, and other professional platforms.
- **Customizing design:** Adjusted the layout, content sections, color scheme, and typography.

## GitHub Pages Deployment 
The website is hosted using GitHub Pages, allowing for easy updates and maintenance.

#### Through this project, I successfully created a comprehensive professional portfolio that effectively showcases my skills in data analysis, technical abilities, and my experience in trading. It also provided valuable experience in web development. I customized the HTML code, CSS code, and utilized Git and GitHub for version control.
