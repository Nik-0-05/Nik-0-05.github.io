# My Personal Website
This website showcases my professional profile and portfolio. It was created using a template from [HTML5 UP](https://html5up.net/). I customized the template to match my personal style and needs, including adding new icons, modifying the layout, and tweaking the overall design.

## Content Integration
I populated the site with my own text, images, and links to create a personalized professional showcase.

## Customizations
I modified the template's HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to tailor the design and functionality to my specific needs. This included:
- Added my personal information, projects, and skills.
- Added Project Links: Each project is linked with a short description and a thumbnail representing the analysis or work involved.
- Added Trader Experience: Added a section that highlights my previous work as an independent derivatives trader.
- Added links to my GitHub, Kaggle, Tableau, and other professional platforms.
- Customized the layout and content sections.
- Adjusted the color scheme and typography.

## GitHub Pages Deployment 
The website is hosted using GitHub Pages, allowing for easy updates and maintenance.

#### This project allowed me to create a comprehensive professional web presence, highlighting my skills in data analysis and my experience in trading. It also provided valuable experience in web development. I customized the HTML code, CSS code, and version control with Git and GitHub.
